## Resources Phase 1
**AI Used:** Claude (Anthropic) was used to aid me with my header file, I was inexperienced in making other files besides (.cpp) I also had trouble running my program on github so I also used AI to help me find alternative websites to run my code.

## Resources Phase 2
**AI Used:** Copilot was used to help me fix a bug. When testing my program I had a typo which led me to notice an error would occur when the user prompted to delete an item that did not exist yet. I had Copilot guide me through creating a bool method to fix that.
